The value of the in config/app.php APP_DEBUG should be set to true during local development

To ensure that the Exeption is called just once you may specify the protected $withoutDuplicates = true; in the Handler file

If the report is called on same instance of Exeption, only the first call will be reported

The $levels in the Handler file should tell the application the priority on the exception eg.     protected $levels = [
        PDOException::class => LogLevel::INFO,
];

If you wanna ignore a exception add it in (However their still have custom rendering logic ):

 protected $dontReport = [
    InvalidOrderException::class,
];


Note : - type-hint => type de variable
       - override => reecrire une method ou variable dans la class enfant
