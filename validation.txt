Sometimes you may wish to stop running validation rules on an attribute after the first validation failure. To do so, assign the bail rule to the attribute: [bail:required]

/**
 * Indicates if the validator should stop on the first rule failure.
 *
 * @var bool
 */
protected $stopOnFirstFailure = true;
/**
 * The URI that users should be redirected to if validation fails.
 *
 * @var string
 */
protected $redirect = '/dashboard';
/**
 * The route that users should be redirected to if validation fails.
 *
 * @var string
 */
protected $redirectRoute = 'dashboard';
